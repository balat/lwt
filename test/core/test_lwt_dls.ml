(* The per-domain slot on its own, before anything in the core depends on it.

   Two properties matter and only one of them is observable without domains: a
   slot must behave as a cell for its owner, and two domains must see two
   independent cells. The second half only builds from OCaml 5, so it lives in
   its own executable, like the storage test. *)

(* Lwt's own tests may use the internal slot. *)
