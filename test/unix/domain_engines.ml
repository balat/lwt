(* An event source belongs to a loop, so each domain must get its own engine and
   neither must see the other's registrations.

   This is safe on the libev side because Lwt's binding calls ev_loop_new rather
   than the default loop, which is what makes several loops in one process
   legitimate. That is what this exercises for real.

   Needs a second domain, hence OCaml 5. *)
