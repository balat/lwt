(* S2's exit criterion: two domains each running their own [Lwt_main.run] AT THE
   SAME TIME, each doing real socket I/O and real timers on their own engine.

   Each domain builds its own socketpair, then runs two Lwt threads on it, a
   writer that sleeps between messages and a reader that consumes them, so the
   loop genuinely blocks in its engine on readability and on a timer rather than
   completing synchronously. A rendezvous makes the overlap real: neither domain
   enters its loop before the other has arrived.

   What this would catch: [Lwt_main.run]'s nested-call flag being process-wide
   (the second domain fails outright), an engine, a run queue or a timer heap
   shared between the two, or a wakeup delivered on the wrong domain.

   Needs a second domain, hence OCaml 5. *)
