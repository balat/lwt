(* An engine may forward a signal itself (Lwt_engine.forwards_signal), and the
   loop running it then needs no process-wide handler. Only the FIRST
   subscriber used to install that handler: if its engine forwarded, a later
   loop with an ordinary engine subscribed to nothing, and the signal took its
   default action, here the end of the process. The handler is now installed by
   the first subscription that needs it.

   Needs other domains, hence OCaml 5. *)
