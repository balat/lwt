(* PER DOMAIN, the whole wheel. This module is a hashed timer wheel driven by
   [Lwt_unix.sleep], which is an engine timer and not a notification, so a second
   domain can perfectly well run its own wheel on its own loop: there is nothing
   process-wide to share here, and everything to lose by sharing, the buckets
   being intrusive doubly-linked lists spliced on every [start] and [stop].

   A timeout therefore belongs to the domain that created it, and carries its
   wheel rather than a domain identity: [start] compares that pointer with the
   caller's wheel, which is one word of comparison, and the operations that
   splice it refuse to touch a wheel that is not theirs. *)
